# Alt Akismet

> Akismet Integration for Statamic!

## Features

This addon lets you integrate Akismet into your Statamic forms. We've tried to put some guesswork into working out which fields are which to try and minimise the amount of config required on forms.

Mark your entries as spam or ham - notifications etc won't come through if marked as spam.

## How to Install

You can search for this addon in the `Tools > Addons` section of the Statamic control panel and click **install**, or run the following command from your project root:

``` bash
composer require alt-design/alt-akismet
```

## How to Use

Once you've got this puppy installed, add `ALT_AKISMET_API_KEY` to your `.env` file, pop your key in, off you go!
